As part of the recruitment process at intelliHR, we ask UX Design Engineers to present an analysis and redesign of an existing workflow or pattern that they believe should be improved.

This can be a style update or a reworking of a user journey, and can be specific to any device, application or even a demographic of user.

## Examples:
- Document an irritating checkout process and present a better workflow.
- Redesign (or create) a discovery interface in a data-intensive application whose search/filter features are lacking
- Update an existing web application to better meet WCAG guidelines

## What we're looking for:
Please submit (via email) an artefact that clearly outlines the identified issues and a recommended solution.  This might be a slide presentation, mockup or an interactive prototype.  

The fidelity of this solution can be high resolution, or just wireframes - as long as the problem and solution can be understood without explanation.

We will ask you to present this solution during the formal interview, and will have questions prepared.
